# Velite Features

Velite is a powerful content layer that transforms your content into type-safe data.

## Key Capabilities

- **Custom Loaders** - Support any file format (JSON5, HTML, EditorJS, etc.)
- **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support with generated types
- **Image Processing** - Automatic optimization with blur placeholders
- **MDX Support** - Compile MDX to executable code

## Why Velite?

Velite provides a flexible schema system that lets you define exactly how your content should be structured and transformed.

```typescript
schema: s.object({
  title: s.string(),
  content: s.markdown(),
  cover: s.image(),
})
```

This ensures your content is always valid and properly typed.
